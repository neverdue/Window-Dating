**<u><span style="font-size:23.0pt"><o:p><span style="text-decoration:none"> </span></o:p></span></u>**

The first step is compiling all the files to make the a.out executable.

If you haven’t already, download the window dating app and then on your terminal,

Type this to go inside the directory: cd Window_Dating

Then run this command to compile the code: g++ *.cpp (might take some time)

Then after some time the code will be compiled and you’re all set to enjoy your experience!

To get started, do the following steps:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>Type this code to run the program: ./a.out  

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>You will be greeted with this screen.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>As you can see, command r will allow you to register a new user, command l will allow you to login with the email and password of an already registered user and command x will let you exit out of the program.  

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>Let’s start by registering ourselves! Go ahead and type r and press enter.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>Now the app will ask you for some information  
Go ahead and type away!

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>After entering in all the information, you should see something like this. Our test user has been successfully registered and logged in (saving you the time to login). The application gives you a quick overview of the total number of registered student users and standard users and then presents one of many randomly selected user as a potential match who you might like. You have the option to hit (like) by entering h or miss (reject) by entering m. Alternatively, you can enter the command x to exit. I will give this user a hit for demonstration of matching but you could potentially keep hitting or missing.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">8.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>Anyway, as mentioned our test user has liked the user “Jensen Brewer” so why don’t we login with their account and give our poor friend test bot a hit and coincidentally a match! (it’s a surprise don’t tell them!).  

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">9.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>If you’re still in the main app view just enter x and you’ll exit out of the app. Now run the app again by entering ./a.out and enter the command l. After that you will be asked to enter your email and password. In this case we are logging in to Jensen’s account.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">10.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>As you can see, you are presented with the same application view upon successfully logging in.

Now we gotta hit or miss until we find test bot and make sure to hit him.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">11.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>As you can see we found our beloved test bot and gave him a hit. The app keeps track of the likes so it was able to match test bot with us (hurray!) and presents us their email id so we can potentially initiate a conversation.

Wohoo! Our friend test bot has a match and he’s oh so happy! (probably not he is a bot with no feelings). As you can see the application is showing test bot Jensen’s email so he can initiate a conversation as well!

<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">13.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"></span> </span></span>But alas our bot wasn’t satisfied and so he went ahead and hit with everyone but the other users didn’t really want to hangout with a bot so they never hit him back and now when test bot logs in to his account, all he finds is this:

<span style="mso-no-proof:yes">![Graphical user interface, text

<span style="mso-tab-count:1"></span> Never be too greedy kids!

<span style="mso-tab-count:1">           </span>

That wasn’t so bad was it?  
Well, now you know how to use this app so what are you waiting for go get yourselves a perfect match, as for test bot, he’s drunk texting his ex binary at the moment.

Anyway, Hope you enjoy!
